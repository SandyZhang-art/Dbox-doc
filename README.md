1. Detect the waving action and the hand flipping action

2. When waving, play the audio of drumming; when flipping hands, play the audio of metal sheet cymbals

3. The faster you wave your hand, the louder the sound and the brighter the light. The slower you wave your hand, the dimmer the light and the quieter the sound. The hand flipping action is the same

4.The greater the amplitude of the waving motion, the more red-purple the color of the light will be; the smaller the amplitude, the more blue-green the color of the light will be. The hand flipping action is the same.

5. The thin-film pressure sensor can identify whether it is currently being pressed by an adult or a child, thereby modifying the parameters of the detection speed. (Because the speed parameter affects volume, color, time, etc.)



Note:

Since these devices currently need to be worn on the hand, it is better to play audio with one speaker than with two speakers (space is limited).

2. Due to the inherent characteristics of the sensor, it requires a large amount of training data for analysis and is sometimes disturbed by environmental and user operation differences, so it is impossible to achieve 100% perfect results.
